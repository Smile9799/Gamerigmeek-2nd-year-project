        <br />
        <br />
        <div style="margin-right:20px">
           4.1. GameRig may from time to time make physical or electronic gift vouchers (“Gift Vouchers”) and promotional coupons or discounts (“Coupons”) available for use on the Website towards the purchase of GameRig Goods. Gift Vouchers and Coupons can only be redeemed while they are valid and their expiry dates cannot be extended. More specifically: <br />
           4.2. Gift Vouchers<br />
       4.2.1. Gift Vouchers that are purchased by registered users are valid for 3 years after Sale. Gift Vouchers that Takealot gives away for free are valid for the period stated thereon. In each case, if your Voucher has not been used within that period, it will expire.<br />
       4.2.2. Gift Vouchers cannot be used to buy other Gift Vouchers or Coupons. They do not accrue interest and are not refundable for cash once purchased. If your Gift Voucher value is insufficient for the order you wish to place, you may make up the difference by paying via one of our other payment methods.<br />
       4.2.3.  GameRig is not responsible for any harm due to the loss, unauthorised use or unauthorised distribution of a Gift Voucher, after it has delivered the Gift Voucher to you or the email address nominated by you.<br />
        4.3.    Coupons<br />
        4.3.1. There are two types of Coupons; a Coupon with a fixed amount of a discount, e.g. R100 off (“Fixed Coupon“), and a Coupon with a percentage discount, e.g. 10% off (“Percentage Coupon“).<br />
       4.3.2. Coupons are issued in Takealot’s sole discretion and we are entitled at any time to correct, cancel or reject a Coupon for any reason (including without limitation where a Coupon has been distributed in an unauthorised manner). Users do not have a right to Coupons, and Coupons cannot be earned. Coupons are issued under specific terms and conditions regulating when and how they may be used.<br />
       4.3.3. As a general rule, and unless specified otherwise on the specific Coupon itself:<br />
          4.3.3.1.  each Coupon can only be used once;<br />
          4.3.3.2. only one Coupon can be used per order;<br />
           4.3.3.3. only one Coupon can be used on the Website per person per promotion/campaign;<br />
          4.3.3.4.  Percentage Coupons may only be redeemed on purchases with a total cart value of less than R5,000;<br />
           4.3.3.5. where a Percentage Coupon has been used and you wish to cancel any items in the order prior to making payment, the entire order must be cancelled. You will be issued with a new Percentage Coupon and will need to place the order again, without the item that you wished to cancel;<br />
         4.3.3.6.   a Coupon must be used at check-out – it cannot be used later on existing orders; and<br />
          4.3.3.7.  the value of the Coupon will be set off against the value of your shopping basket and the balance remaining, if any, will be payable by you.<br />
      4.3.4.  Coupons cannot be used to buy Gift Vouchers or other Coupons, and cannot be exchanged or refunded for cash or credit. GameRig is not responsible for any harm due to the loss, unauthorised use or distribution of a Coupon.<br />
       4.3.5. If for any reason a Coupon does not reflect on the final amount due from you at check-out, you can contact us here to confirm if the Coupon is still valid.  If GameRig confirms that the Coupon is still valid and you have already placed your order, you can choose whether to cancel the order and place it again with the Coupon, or you can use the Coupon on your next order within the limitations of the specific Coupon’s terms and conditions.<br />
       4.3.6. You may be required to submit the original communication containing the Coupon code, and any other information reasonably requested by GameRig, before you are able to use a Coupon.<br />
